SchoolEd is a application made to streamline the school-teacher-student interactions via the web.

STEPS TO START:      In Terminal
server-              node server/index.js
webpack-             webpack -w
db-                  node server/db/index.js
db insert data-      node server/insertData.js

after seeding, make a new user Alex as a student, with any password
Log out, then log back in as Alex (current issue with rendering, need to logout and relog to see classlist)
After relogging in, click Classes tab to see a list of classes currently enrolled in, as well as any lectures/topics 
from that class.

I have all my controllers/routers for crud operations for each, however ran out of time to implement them in the frontend
(refer to server/controllers && server/routers)
